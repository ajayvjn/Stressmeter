# Stressmeter

<b>FIX BEFORE IT HITS</b>

<b>Stressmeter</b> is an IoT product which is a real-time 24/7 low cost monitoring and warning system which analyses stress on a structure and alerts the user before the structure reaches it's threshold.

We have used Particle Photon and an android app to monitor and alert the users in this project.

<b>Inspiration:</b>  
Incidents related to structural collapse and loss of lives.

<b>What it does:</b>  
Detects the stress and prevents any instability in a structure

<b>How I built it:</b>  
Using Particle Photon and flex sensors

<b>Challenges I ran into:</b>  
Programming the particle photon and integrating android app with it

<b>Accomplishments that I'm proud of:</b>  
The application works in real-time and has potential to save lives.

<b>What I learned:</b>  
Concepts of IOT and hardware implementations

<b>What's next for Stressmeter:</b>  
As of now we have successfully implemented it into bridges. would possibly extend it to other form of structures like buildings, dams etc.

<b>Built With:</b>  
C,  
javascript,  
css,  
java,
